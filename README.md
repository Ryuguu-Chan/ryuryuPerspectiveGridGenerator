## TODOLIST

° implementing the Undo/Redo functionality<br/>
° implementing code that will let the user placing the vanishing points far beyond the panel and window zone<br/>
° letting the user choose the amount of lines to be drawn<br/>
° letting the user choosing a background image if they want to<br/>
° all the lines could be editable on live<br/>
° probably other things in the future...
